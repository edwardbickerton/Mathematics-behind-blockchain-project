# Mathematics-behind-blockchain-project

A project completed as part of my undergraduate degree explaining the key components of Bitcoin.

The directory, [`code`](/code), contains the code used to demonstrate:

- hashing algorithms,
- merkle trees, and
- proof of work (Hashcash).

For the digital signature code see [`RSA-cryptosystem`](https://github.com/edwardbickerton/RSA-cryptosystem).
